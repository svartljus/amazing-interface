# WebREPL Shader hack

IP is hardcoded

Sliders that set variables in python

Shader script that replaces the shader function

Bootstrapping script that starts shader thread

(The scripts should probably save to a file that is loaded on startup)

Just serve the webpage in any way; `npx serve` for example.
